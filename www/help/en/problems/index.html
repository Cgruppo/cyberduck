<!--                <p><b>The application doesn't launch; it crashes
                immediatly</b><br />
                Make sure to install the latest Java Update
                available in Software Update. Refer to <a class=

<!--                <p><b>I can't add a password to a
                bookmark!</b><br />
                Passwords aren't saved with bookmarks but in the
                Keychain. Select the checkbox "Add Password to
                Keychain" upon login.</p>
-->
                <p><b>Special characters such as Umlaute aren't
                displayed correctly in the browser.</b><br />
                Try to change the character encoding used. See
                'View' &gt; 'Encoding'.</p>

                <p><b>The folder size isn't displayed
                correctly.</b><br />
                This is not the size of its content but the size of
                the folder itself.</p>

                <p><b>When listing a directory on a FTP server I
                get the error message in response to the 'LIST -a'
                command: 550 Directory not found.</b><br />
                Uncheck the option 'FTP &gt; Send LIST -a command'
                in the Preferences.</p>

                <p><b>It is not possible to change permissions. The
                error message 'FTP Error: SITE not understood' or
                similar is displayed.</b><br />
                The server does not support this feature (which is
                an optional extension to the FTP protocol) and can
                not be used.</p>

                <p><b>The server does only allow one single
                connection; I can't transfer any files!</b><br />
                Limit the maximum number of simultaneous to a
                server to one in the 'Advanced' tab in the
                Preferences. The transfer of a file will then wait
                until you close the browsing connection. If the
                browsing connection should be closed automatically,
                then also check 'Force other connections to close
                when maximum is reached'.</p>

                <p><b>The connection to the server frequently times
                out; I want it to stay it alive if at all
                possible!</b><br />
                You can force Cyberduck to send a no operation
                command at a given time interval. See the
                'Advanced' tab in the Preferences.</p>

                <p><b>I often get an error titled <code>IO Error:
                Broken pipe</code>.</b><br />
                There was a problem with the unerlying network
                stream either because the connection was too slow
                or the server wouldn't give a response.</p>

                <p><b>I get an error titled <code>IO Error: Read
                Timed Out</code> when attempting to open a
                connection.</b><br />
                There is either a firewall blocking requests or no
                server is listening at the given address and
                protocol.</p>

<!--                <p><b>I have installed the Java 5 Developer Preview
                and now Cyberduck doesn't launch anymore.</b><br />
                There was a bug in DP1 and DP2. Pleae upgrade to
                DP3.</p>
-->
                <p><b>I can't select any external editor.</b><br />
                Install one of the supported editors and launch it
                first. Also relaunch Cyberduck if the editor is
                still not selectable. If that still doesn't work
                out, please refer to <a href=
                "http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20031215144430486">
                this article</a>.</p>

                <p><b>My preferred editor isn't
                supported.</b><br />
                An editor must support the external editor
                protocol (ODB).</p>

<!-->                <p><b>I want ot use the latest beta of skEdit which
                supports the external editor protocol as an
                editor.</b><br />
                Issue the following commands in a Terminal.app
                window (copy &amp; paste) and relaunch
                Cyberduck:</p>

                <p><code>defaults write ch.sudo.cyberduck
                editor.name skEdit<br />
                defaults write ch.sudo.cyberduck
                editor.bundleIdentifier org.skti.skEdit</code></p>
-->
                <p><b>I don't want to synchronize files if only
                e.g. the minutes differ in the timestamp!</b><br />
                You can configure Cberduck to ignore certain values
                when comparing the modification date of files. Open
                a Terminal.app and type:</p>

                <p><code>defaults write ch.sudo.cyberduck
                queue.sync.ignore.second true</code><br />
                <code>defaults write ch.sudo.cyberduck
                queue.sync.ignore.minute true<br />
                defaults write ch.sudo.cyberduck
                queue.sync.ignore.hour false</code><br /></p>

                <p>By default, milliseconds and seconds are
                ignored.</p>
