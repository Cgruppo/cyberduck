	Common Problems</h2>

	<div id="content">
		<p><b>Special characters such as Umlaute aren't displayed
		correctly in the browser.</b><br />
		Try to change the character encoding used. See 'View' →
		'Text Encoding'. Try UTF-8 (the default), ISO-8859-1 and
		Windows-1252.</p>

		<p><b>The folder size isn't displayed correctly.</b><br />
		This is not the size of its content but the size of the
		folder itself. Use 'File' → 'Info' to calculate the size
		recursively of all contained files.</p>

		<p><b>It is not possible to change permissions. The error
		message <tt>FTP Error: SITE not understood</tt> or similar is
		displayed.</b><br />
		The server does not support this feature (which is an
		optional extension to the FTP protocol) and can not be
		used.</p>

		<p><b>The connection to the server frequently times out; I
		want it to stay it alive if at all possible!</b><br />
		You can force Cyberduck to send a 'no operation' command at a
		given time interval. See the 'Advanced' tab in the
		Preferences.</p>

		<p><b>I often get an error titled <code>IO Error: Broken
		pipe</code>.</b><br />
		There was a problem with the unerlying network stream
		either because the connection was too slow or the server
		wouldn't give a response.</p>

		<p><b>I get an error titled <code>IO Error: Read Timed
		Out</code> when attempting to open a connection.</b><br />
		There is either a firewall blocking requests or no server
		is listening at the given address and protocol.</p>

		<p><b>I can't select any external editor.</b><br />
		Install one of the supported editors and launch it first.
		Also relaunch Cyberduck if the editor is still not
		selectable. If that still doesn't work out, please refer to
