				<p class="bold">How to configure public key
				authentication?</p>

				<p>Public-key authentication allows you to connect to a
				remote server without sending your password over the
				Internet. Public-key authentication uses two keys, a
				private key that only you have--it should be kept in a
				secure place and protected with a password. And the public
				key, which is placed on the server you wish to gain access
				to, usually by the system administrator when your account
				is set up.</p>

				<p>1. Run the command 'ssh-keygen' from the
				Terminal.app to generate a public/private pair of
				keys. They will be put in your directory ~/.ssh,
				though you will probably be asked to approve or
				change this location.<br />
				When you generate the keys you will be asked for a
				'passphrase'. If you use a passphrase then you will
				have to enter it each time you use the keys for
				authentication. That is, you will have to type in
				the pass phrase everytime you log in, just as you
				would with a password.<br />
				If you don't enter a passphrase (just press the
				return key) then you will be allowed to log-in
				without having to enter a passphrase. This is less
				secure, but it can be really useful.<br /></p>

				<div>
					<code>jungle:~/.ssh dkocher$ ssh-keygen -t
					rsa</code>
				</div>

				<p>2. Copy the public key to the remote host you
				wish to access and add it to the file
				authorized_keys in your ~/.ssh directory. (If that
				file does not exist then you should create it.)
				Anybody listed in the authorized_keys file (via
				their public key) is allowed to log-in, provided
				that they can prove that they possess the
				corresponding private key. Thus if you have the
				private key in your .ssh directory on your home
				machine you'll be allowed in.<br /></p>

				<div>
					<code>jungle:~/.ssh dkocher$ ssh hostname &lt;
					id_rsa.pub 'cat &gt;&gt;
					.ssh/authorized_keys'</code>
				</div>

				<p>3. In the Connection Dialog or the Bookmark
				editor in Cyberduck select 'Use Public Key
				Authentication' and select the private key in your
				.ssh directory.</p>
