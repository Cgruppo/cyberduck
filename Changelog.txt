FTP and SFTP Browser for Mac OS X
http://cyberduck.ch/

Cyberduck is an open source SFTP (SSH Secure File Transfer) and FTP browser licenced under the GPL for the Mac. 
Cyberduck features the same intuitive interface for both FTP and SFTP browsing. 
You can open connections to multiple servers with its document based interface. A bookmark manager 
allows you to store frequently-used servers. Bookmarks can be exported as a regular file by dragging them to the Finder.
Drag and drop is supported for both downloading and uploading files. Just drag the file(s) or folder from the Finder 
to the browser window or vice versa to start the transfer. 
File deletion and renaming, checking and changing of permissions is possible with a Finder-like info panel. 
Rendezvous is supported. Keychain integration.
